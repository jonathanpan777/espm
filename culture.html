							<p>The social construction created for the Chinese stems from the racism embedded from the beginning of the California gold rush. When the Chinese migrated to mine gold, they were met with great opposition and violence. There was a foreigner miner tax and they were not allowed to testify against White people. Physically, the Chinese were smaller compared to the average and when they did resist, it was often more indirect. Chinese people opened necessary businesses and services and relied on social cultural resources. At the time religion in China was heavily focused on Daoism, which promoted harmony. In East meet West scenarios, this could have been a contributing factor for the “docile” Chinese (Zhigang). No matter the factors, general racism and a need for cheap labor likely created the stereotype of the obedient clever working Chinese.  
							</p>

							<p>In 1867, the “docile” Chinese made their first strike against the railway companies. “And this work stoppage was the largest labor action in the country at that time,'' claimed Hilton Obenzinger (Fuchs). In response, their food and supplies were cut off until they returned to work. No compromises were made, but historians do believe it helped change the image of the obedient docile Chinese man. Farther down the line, wages were increased, but White workers would have food and other costs covered. In the end, the Chinese would continue on to face much discrimination and often be blamed for taking jobs at lower wages.
							</p>

							<p>Because of their “obedience and cleverness”, they were often tasked with handling black powder to blow up tunnels to speed up progress. Progress was made at around one foot per day in the tunnels, but because the Union Pacific company was in a race with the Central Pacific company, they needed the Chinese to work faster and with more dangerous chemicals. Nitro was introduced as it was eight times more powerful than gunpowder. It was much more dangerous and many deaths were caused by rockfalls or avalanches that were a result of explosions.
