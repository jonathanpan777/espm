							<p>During the Civil war in 1862 Abraham Lincoln signed The Pacific Railway Act, which provided government support for connecting the western railway to the eastern to create the nation’s first transcontinental railroad. The Union Pacific railway companies would be paid by the government based on the miles of railway that they laid. During the Civil War there was a labor shortage and at first the Union Pacific companies would try to recruit Irish men. Cornish miners, veterans, and irish men were the only people initially. Later on they would move to experiment by hiring Chinese people in 1864 when labor became scarce. They began by recruiting around fifty people who had already immigrated due to the Gold Rush. After the success of their experiment, they would move on to recruit Chinese men from overseas and eventually the Chinese would make up 90% of the railway workforce and lay roughly 690 miles of railway from Sacramento to Utah. 
							</p>

							<p>During the same time period, many Chinese that lived near Hong Kong were experiencing the front lines of the Opium Wars. This caused a mass migration of 2.5 million to leave China to seek a new life. Many impoverished single Chinese men would find their way to California to work on the Western half of the railway. 
							</p>

							<p>Chinese people were shipped overseas and essentially treated the same way as a natural resource. Compared to Irish workers that were categorized as lazy, Chinese people had nowhere to go and were obedient workers. There was great segregation in all parts of the system. Pay for Chinese workers was reduced by half compared to White workers, longer hours, dangerous tasks, and tents instead of modified train cars were given to the Chinese (Polk). 
							</p>

							<p>From the massive number of emigrations orchestrated by the railway companies and the clear discrimination of the Chinese, it becomes clear that the Chinese were seen much more as a product than people. They were ideal workers that would work at lower wages, do the tasks that no one wanted to do, and best of all they would not retaliate. Chinese men were advertised as docile and quick learners. Chinese workers would be whipped or even restrained at certain occasions when they tried to leave for other work. Workers were imported and disposed of based on the company’s needs.
							</p>

							<p>In 1867, the “docile” Chinese made their first strike against the railway companies. “And this work stoppage was the largest labor action in the country at that time,'' claimed Hilton Obenzinger (Fuchs). In response, their food and supplies were cut off until they returned to work. No compromises were made, but historians do believe it helped change the image of the obedient docile Chinese man. In the end, the Chinese would continue on to face much racism and often be blamed for taking jobs at lower wages.Thirteen years later, the Chinese exclusion act would be passed to remove the Chinese from America.
