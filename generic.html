								<p>"They built the Great Wall of China, didn't they?" - Charles Crocker</p>
								<h2></h2>
							</header>
							<p>During the Civil war in 1862 Abraham Lincoln signed The Pacific Railway Act, which provided government support for connecting the western railway to the eastern to create the nation’s first transcontinental railroad. The Union and Central Pacific railway companies would be paid by the government based on the miles of railway that they laid. It was essentially a competition between the two companies as whoever laid more miles would be paid more. During the Civil War there was a labor shortage and at first the Union Pacific companies would try to recruit Irish men. Cornish miners, veterans, and irish men were the only people initially. Later on they would move to experiment by hiring Chinese people in 1864 when labor became scarce. They began by recruiting around fifty people who had already immigrated due to the Gold Rush. After the success of their experiment, they would move on to recruit Chinese men from overseas and eventually the Chinese would make up 90% of the railway workforce and lay around 700 miles of railway from Sacramento to Utah (Nadja).
							</p>
							
							<p>During the same time period, many Chinese that lived near Hong Kong were experiencing the front lines of the Opium Wars. This caused a mass migration of 2.5 million to leave China to seek a new life. Many impoverished single Chinese men would find their way to California to work on the Western half of the railway (Shao). At first, the Chinese they migrated were there for the gold rush, but racism and taxes kept them from making it too far in mining. They would turn to very low paying jobs and when the railroad companies began recruiting, the wages were comparably higher. 
							</p>

							<p>Chinese people were shipped overseas and essentially treated the same way as a natural resource. Compared to Irish workers that were categorized as lazy, Chinese people had nowhere to go and were obedient workers. There was great segregation in all parts of the system. Pay for Chinese workers was reduced by half compared to White workers, longer hours, dangerous tasks, and tents instead of modified train cars were given to the Chinese (Polk). 
							</p>

							<p>From the massive number of emigrations orchestrated by the railway companies and the clear discrimination of the Chinese, it becomes clear that the Chinese were seen much more as a product than people. They were ideal workers that would work at lower wages, do the tasks that no one wanted to do, and best of all they would not retaliate. Chinese men were advertised as docile and quick learners. Chinese workers would be whipped or even restrained at certain occasions when they tried to leave for other work. Workers were imported and disposed of based on the company’s needs. Thirteen years later, the Chinese exclusion act would be passed to remove the Chinese from America.
